# Interactive Coffee Table

I've started to refurbish this project.
"Origianl" CAD and code can be found in the `legacy` directory and on the [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Interactive-Arduino-Powered-Coffee-Table/).

## Current

Work in progress.

## Legacy

The original components comprised of:
  -  Arduino Mega
  -  Ethernet shield
  -  Bluetooth audio receiver
  -  Stereo audio amplifiers and speakers
  -  16x16 LED matrix
  -  20x4 LCD
  -  40x2 LCD
  -  6 button keypad with 2 LEDs

Original functionality included:
  - Last.fm now playing notification
  - News/weather? (IIRC)
  - Music visualisation
  - Bluetooth speaker

A bit later I rewrote the firmware (to what is now present in the `lecacy/InteractiveCoffeeTable` directory) to include a snake game.
