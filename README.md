InteractiveCoffeeTable
======================

For archival purposes I'm moving all my code and CAD files for this project here, who knows, I may have another (home automation) use for this table later.

Original project (with original CAD files and (bad) code) can be found [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Interactive-Arduino-Powered-Coffee-Table/).

The original components comprised of:
*  Arduino Mega
*  Ethernet shield
*  Bluetooth audio receiver
*  Stereo audio amplifiers and speakers
*  16x16 LED matrix
*  20x4 LCD
*  40x2 LCD
*  6 button keypad with 2 LEDs
